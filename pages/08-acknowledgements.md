The authors are grateful to Dave Watts (OBISAU) and Seb Mancini (AODN) for providing updates to the data release section for Version 2, as well as the many colleagues and crew over the years who shared field experiences and insights with the co-authors, thereby shaping this manual. In particular, Matthew McArthur helped foster enthusiasm for small macrofauna and infauna in the lead author early in her career.
